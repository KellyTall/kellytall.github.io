        <h3>Log</h3>
        <p>My child is quite into history and changing world boarders at the moment so I suggested we get some historial mapping data and make our own! </p>
        <p>This <a href="https://www.gislounge.com/find-gis-data-historical-country-boundaries/" target="_blank">article</a> provided some ideas on where to look, so I thought I'd check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080328104539/http://library.thinkquest.org:80/C006628/download.html" target="_blank">the first one listed </a> that's found on the wayback machine. There appears to be a lot of caveats on the accuracy of these ones, but as a starter, it will do!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Used the steps I went through on <a href="day_five.html" target="_blank">Day Five</a> and converted the shape files to geoJson then topoJson. The files weren't too big, so decided to skip simplifying them. </p>
            </li>

            <li><p>Used <code>d3.geoEqualEarth()</code> as the <a href= "https://github.com/d3/d3-geo-projection" target="_blank">geo projection </a> </li>
                <li><p>Added labels. There is lots of overlap in Europe, so possibly next step,I'll work out a ounding box and create some maps that focus on their areas of interest. </p></li>
