							<p>In 1770, HMS Endeavour sailed along the East Coast of Australia, and eigtheen years later a fleet

Two hundred and fifty years later we are still errecting stutues in honour of these events. <br> 	What do we try and say about ourselves by still honouring or celebrating this past? <br>And consquently, what other parts of our past are hidden or ignored?

								<h2>Introduction</h2>

							</div>

							<div class="col-md-6">

								<p>In February 2019, the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/" target="_blank" type="text/html">Southern Poverty Law Centre (SPLC) </a>published a paper entitled <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/20190201/whose-heritage-public-symbols-confederacy" target="-_blank" type="text/html"><i>"Whose Heritage? Public Symbols of the Confederacy" </i></a>that reports on the number of US public institutions or monuments dedicated to Confederate figures over time.  They state in the report <i><strong>"We encourage communities across the country to reflect on the true meaning of these symbols and ask the question: Whose heritage do they truly represent?"</i></strong>. Australia has not had the same reckoning with it's past as the United States, but in recent times there has been growing questioning about our own heritage and the symbols that we chose to represent this past, and what they say about our nation today.  </p>
							
							</div>	

							<div class="col-md-6">

								<p>With the 250 year anniversary of Cook's voyage approaching, these questions emerge as equally important here as they do in the USA. Important works such as Bruce Pascoe's <i>Dark Emu</i> and <i>The Biggest Estate on Earth: How Aborigines made Australia </i>by Bill Gammage, show us that the history we have been have been taught is based on a white-colonial lens. While the number of monuments we are errecting in honour of our colonial past is slowing, they are still being dedicated. What are we saying about our past and our future if we still are honouring and recognising these dead white men?</p>

							<h2>Defacing Statues of Cook</h2>
		
								<p>Many statues of James Cook have been graffitied in cities across Australia and New Zealand, frequently in the lead up to Australia Day. Malcolm Turnbull, who was Prime Monister at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/26/captain-cook-statue-and-two-others-in-sydneys-hyde-park-attacked-by-vandals" target="-_blank" type="text/html">the time of on incident in 2018 </a>, likened these actions to Stalin's re-writing of history and removing his enemies from the records.  <i>"Tearing down or defacing statues of our colonial era explorers and governors is not much better than that,"</i> said Turnbull. </p><p>He made no mention of the genocide of First Nation People that followed the arrival of whites to Australia, or the growing <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.au/change-the-date/ target="-_blank" type="text/html">Change the Date</a> movement, that calls for 26th January not be a day of national celebration.  The question again can be asked, whose history is being celebrated or venerated? And what parts of our history is being ignored or overlooked?</p>

					<h2>Visualising the Monuments made for Three Periods of Colonial History</h2>

					<p>The following sections contain data visualisations of monuments erected for three main periods of White Australian Colonial History. The first period relates to James Cook and the voyage of the Endeavour in 1770. The second is the arrival of the First Fleet and the first Govenor of NSW, Arthur Phillip in 1788. The third covers a period of colonial expansion under the Governor of NSW, Lachlan Macquiarie, from 1810 until 1821. </p>

						<h2>Anniversaries are times to lay down a plaque</h2>
	

						<p>This chart shows the arc of a monument; a line from the source "event" of the historical period, to the time it was dedicated. Each arc represents a monument, and the thickness of the arc represents the number of monuments dedicated in that year. Unsurprisingly, both the 200 year anniversaries of the <span style="color: #3D200F; font-weight: 600;">Endeavour's arrival in 1970 </span> and <span style="color: #CD9C05; font-weight: 600;">the First Fleet in 1988</span>, saw the greatest number of monuments dedicated for both periods. The Endeavour 200 year anniversary in 1770 saw 36 new monuments in total.  Interestingly, monuments to <span style="color: #319D89; font-weight: 600;">Macquarie and the Colonial Expansion period </span>are steady throughout time, and even with no major celebration in 2010, there has only ten fewer monuments overall than the other periods. <em>Macquarie has had no fewer than fourteen monuments dedicacted to him in the last ten years.</em>  </p>

								<h2>Monuments over the decades</h2>
				

								<p>The 70s and the 80s saw a fevour of activity with monuments, as the nation celebrated Cook, the Bicentenary and the beginning of Federation. Again, although Macquarie and colonial exapnsion have seen no major national events or celebrations, there has consistently been dedications to him and this historical period, particulalry around Macquarie Street and the Northern end of the Sydney CBD. Macquarie is often referred to as the Father of the Colony, and many admire his leadership in the transition of NSW from Penal Colony to free-settlement and beyond to Federation. What is often not talked about in relation to Macquarie how his expansion impacted the local Indigenous communities. He was responsible for orders that resulted in the <a href="https://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/appin_massacre" target="_blank" type="text/html">Appin Masacre </a>. He instructed that First Nations people be cleared off the land. Many were shot, and some were forced over a cliff in order to clear th eland designated to free settlers.</p>
