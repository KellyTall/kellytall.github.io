         <p>Sometimes you just need a little text and a number</p>

         <p>I have to produce some reports and at times I don't want to make a chart, just a list and corresponding numbers. Here I loooked back at some tutorials from <a href="https://www.superhi.com/courses/data-visualization-with-d3" target="_blank">superHi's data visualisation / D3 course </a> (which I would highly recommend!). </p>
         <p>Even though I've been plkuging away at D3 now, I still get a bit confused about groups, and selections and so forth, but here is what I tink is going on </p>
         <ol>
             <li>Create a group for each of the rows based on the number of rows in the data set</li>
             <li>In the group append some text to it - the SA3 name</li>
             <li>Append more text: this time the number of dwellings in each SA3</li>
             <li>Then style in CSS</li>
         </ol>

         <p>Becasue I'm not very comfortable in JS, I tend to learn things and then crib from these tutorials. It often leads to mistakes, but I find I am getting better (I hope ðŸ˜¬) at woring out at least what is going on. Learning from dofferent people has meant I sometimes get a bit mixed up in the differences in styles. Doing these regulalry at least helps build some of that <em>recognition</em> ...</p>

         <p>The date today is actually 19th July so I am a bit behind, but committed at least to do one for each day, even if these days are behind. Comfort in the knowledge that I have been making all kinds of maps for a client which has been fantastic (and also good to buid some of the things i have learnt in here into small examples so that I can easly find them in the future)</p>

         <p>Note: I also used a sorting example I have back in <a href="day_two.html" target="_blank">day two</a> - it's already helping ðŸ™ƒ</p>
