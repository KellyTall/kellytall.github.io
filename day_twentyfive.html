        <h3>Log</h3>
        <p>If you look carefully at the dates of my 100 days, you will see a very large gap. I was never good at
        updating this every day, and now I have started back at full time work, I have really taken a big haitus. But I really enjoyed making maps for my last freelance job, and saw that there is a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/30DayMapChallenge?src=hashtag_click&f=live" target="_blank">#30DayMapChallenge</a> and figured this was a good thing to help practice map making. I realise there is so much to making a good map in D3, so excited to see other maps to pick up some skills. Typography! LabellingColours! Projections! Data! So much to learn.
    </p>
    <p>To ease myself back into this, I am re-doing the tree map that I was fiddling around with before. I downlaoded some more data - this time the Moreton Bay Figs listed in the COS </p>
        <p>As ever code can be found <a href="https://github.com/KellyTall/kellytall.github.io/blob/master/js/day_twentyfive.js" target="_blank">here</a></p>
