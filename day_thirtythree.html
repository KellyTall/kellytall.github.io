        <h3>Log</h3>
        <p>Data is yet again from OpenStreetMap <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/" target="_blank">overpass turbo</a>; it's such a great resource. </p>
        <code>
            [out:json];<br>
            area[name = "Marrickville"];<br>
            (way(area)["highway"~"^(motorway|trunk|primary|secondary|tertiary|residential)$"];>;);<br>
            out;<br>
        </code>
        <p>I was worried that mapping streets would be different, but it wasn't! I discovered this looking through the tutorial posted on Observable by Florian Ledermann <a href="https://observablehq.com/@floledermann/drawing-maps-from-geodata-in-d3?collection=@floledermann/tutorials" target="_blank">here</a>. Florian pointed out that the data for his street map included a "w" property that could set the stroke width. My data didn;t include a "w" property (which indicates a street's relevance or weighting). The data I have includes a "width" variable which I guess is the literal width of the street. I used this to set the weight of each edge - it's not as good as a proper weight, but that's OK. I quite like the look of this map - it's not much but I like the simplicity of it. </p>
