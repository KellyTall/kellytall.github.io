        <p>If you look at this chart compared to the previous day, there is no obvious change, but I have made some tweaks that would mean a screen-reader could pass on some more info to someone who comes along to this page who may need to use one.  I need to do some more work on this though. I have appended a title to the wrapper like so: </p>
        <p><code>
            wrapper<br>
        .attr("role", "figure")<br>
        .attr("tabindex", "0")<br>
        .append("title")<br>
        .text("Bar chart that shows the ranked order of NDIS participants with SDA supports")<br>
        </code></p> 
        <p>This title can be read by a screen reader, but there is something in my formatting in another area that's making the values be understood as really high numbers - more work to do here! </p>
